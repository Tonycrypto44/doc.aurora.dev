TODO

The Aurora CLI can be used to perform executions directly to the Aurora EVM which may be preferable in
some cases. This enables the ability to directly interface with the EVM contract on NEAR instead of
through other usual Ethereum interfaces.

This method however requires that you setup a NEAR environment with wallets.

::warning
This is intended for advanced users and NEAR developers.
